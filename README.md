# SIH 2K24

This project is a React Native-based mobile application designed for Shape and Area Measurement with GPS support, which allows users to draw polygons, mark important locations (such as Borewells and Wells), and calculate the area of a selected region. The project is a part of Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024.

## Features

- **GPS-based Shape Drawing:** Draw polygons on the map representing a specific area, with real-time GPS data.
- **Area Calculation:** Calculate the area of the drawn shape (in acres).
- **Marker Placement:** Place Borewell and Well markers on the map at precise locations.
- **Line Drawing:** Draw lines between specific points with an option to undo the last drawn line.
- **Save and Submit:** Save shapes, markers, and lines, and navigate to the next screen for further processing.
